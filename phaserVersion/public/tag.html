            <h2>About the Project</h2>
            <p>
                <span class='underlined'>in C.</span>is a minimalist composition by Terry Riley, where any number
                (Terry suggests 35) of
                performers of
                any
                kind
                of instrument repeat each of 53 phrases many times as desired. In the context of covid-19 regulations
                prohibiting performance, I am creating two UIs for a single individual to play this music.
            </p>
            <h3>Composer Mode</h3>
            <p>Composer view is a react UI where the user takes full control of starting, prodding, and mixing the
                musicians. I
                eventually hope to add a backend for persisting musicians created by users.</p>
            <h3>Phaser Game</h3>
            <p>

                If you've ever wanted conduct an ensemble of musicians, or its rough equivalent herd a cats, this game
                is
                for
                you.
                Presently you are a star that prods musicians to the next phrase by colliding with them. I hope to
                replace
                this
                stub
                with a spritesheet of a walking conductor swinging a baton. Future additions may include pizza and beer,
                to
                attract
                the musicians.</p>
            <h2>How to Play</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Press start button to start Tone.js.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Start all musicians by pressing left.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Now collide with each player as the star to prod that player onto the next phrase.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Enjoy. Open the console if you want to see which phrase each musician is on.
                </li>
