    <h2>About the Project</h2>
    <p>*inC* is a minimalist composition by Terry Riley, where any number (Terry suggests 53) of performers of any kind
        of instrument repeat each of 53 phrases many times as desired. In the context of covid-19 regulations
        prohibiting performance, I am creating two UIs for a single individual to play this music.</p>
    <h3>Composer Mode</h3>
    <p>Composer view is a react UI where the user takes full control of starting, prodding, and mixing the musicians. I
        eventually hope to add a backend for persisting musicians created by users.</p>
    <h3>Phaser Game</h3>
    If you've ever wanted conduct an ensemble of musicians, or its rough equivalent herd cats, this game is for you.
    Presently you are a star that prods musicians to the next phrase by colliding with them. I hope to replace this stub
    with a spritesheet of a walking conductor swinging a baton. Future additions may include pizza and beer, to attract
    the musicians.
    <h2>How to Play</h2>
    <p>Press left to start Tone.js. Then collide with each player as the star to prod that player onto the next phrase.
        Enjoy. Open the console if you want to see which phrase each musician is on. </p>
